    "### 100 points [5% of your final grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: Monday, February 12 by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get hands-on experience with (i) the basics of machine learning (e.g. train/test data, cross-validation, different classifiers) and interpreting results; and (ii) learning to rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission Instructions:* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as UIN_hw#.ipynb. For example, this homework submission would be: YourUIN_hw1.ipynb. Submit this notebook via ecampus. Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use up to three of your late days, meaning that no submissions will be accepted after Thursday, February 15 at 11:59pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",

    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."
